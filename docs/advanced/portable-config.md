# Portable Config

`PortableConfig` expresses a firewall ruleset as plain, JSON-serializable data instead of PHP closures. Because a ruleset is data, you can:

- **store it in a database** and pick up rule changes on the next request,
- **ship it through a config service** (etcd, Consul, S3, a settings table),
- **diff and review it in git**, or
- **share one ruleset across many apps, processes, or languages**

…and then apply it onto a live [`Config`](/getting-started) with [`Config::with()`](/advanced/config-composition); the schema is pure data and never carries a cache. A `PortableConfig` is a [`ConfigLayer`](/advanced/config-composition), so it composes through the same `with()` call as any other layer. Closures are never serialized, so the surface is intentionally a safe, declarative subset (see [Not portable by design](#not-portable-by-design)).

## Building and round-tripping

Build a ruleset fluently, export it with `toArray()` (or `json_encode()` the result), and rebuild it with `fromArray()`, then apply it onto a `Config` with `Config::with()`:

```php
use Flowd\Phirewall\Config;
use Flowd\Phirewall\Http\Firewall;
use Flowd\Phirewall\Pattern\PatternKind;
use Flowd\Phirewall\Portable\PortableConfig;

$portable = PortableConfig::create()
    ->setKeyPrefix('shop')
    ->enableRateLimitHeaders()
    ->enableResponseHeaders()
    ->safelist('health', PortableConfig::filterPathEquals('/health'))
    ->blocklist('admin-probe', PortableConfig::filterPathPrefix('/wp-admin'))
    ->blocklist('scanners', PortableConfig::filterKnownScanners())
    ->blocklist('bad-net', PortableConfig::filterIp(['203.0.113.0/24']))
    ->throttle('api', limit: 100, period: 60, key: PortableConfig::keyHashedHeader('X-Api-Key'), sliding: true)
    ->allow2ban('volume-cap', threshold: 1000, period: 60, ban: 300, key: PortableConfig::keyIp())
    ->fail2ban('wp-login-probe', threshold: 5, period: 60, ban: 900, filter: PortableConfig::filterPathEquals('/wp-login.php'), key: PortableConfig::keyIp())
    ->patternBlocklist('threats', [
        PortableConfig::patternEntry(PatternKind::CIDR, '10.66.0.0/16'),
        PortableConfig::patternEntry(PatternKind::PATH_REGEX, '#/\.git(/|$)#'),
    ]);

// Export as data …
$json = json_encode($portable->toArray(), JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR);

// … and rebuild a live Config somewhere else.
$config   = (new Config($cache))->with(PortableConfig::fromArray(json_decode($json, true, 512, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR)));
$firewall = new Firewall($config);
```

`fromArray()` validates the *shape* of the data (rule/filter/key types, regex patterns compile, pattern-entry fields) and throws `InvalidArgumentException` on anything malformed. It does **not** verify *authenticity*; for that, see [Signed transport](#signed-transport).

## The catalogue

Everything `PortableConfig` can express today.

### Rules

| Builder | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `safelist(name, filter)` | Bypass all checks when the filter matches |
| `blocklist(name, filter)` | Deny (403) when the filter matches |
| `throttle(name, limit, period, key, sliding = false, scope = null)` | Fixed or sliding-window rate limit (429); the optional `scope` filter restricts which requests the throttle counts (e.g. only `/api`) |
| `fail2ban(name, threshold, period, ban, filter, key)` | Auto-ban after repeated matching ("bad") requests |
| `allow2ban(name, threshold, period, ban, key)` | Hard volume cap: ban after too many *total* requests for a key |
| `track(name, period, filter, key, limit = null)` | Passive counting with optional alert threshold |
| `addPatternBackend(name, entries)` | Register a reusable catalogue of block patterns |
| `blocklistFromBackend(name, backendName)` | Add a blocklist that matches against a registered backend |
| `patternBlocklist(name, entries)` | Convenience: register a backend and a blocklist under one name |

### Filters (request predicates)

| Factory | Matches when … |
|---------|----------------|
| `filterAll()` | always |
| `filterNone()` | never: a filter that never matches; use it for a rule that must not be assertable from any request property (e.g. a fail2ban driven solely by `RequestContext::recordFailure`) |
| `filterPathEquals(path)` | the path equals `path` |
| `filterPathPrefix(prefix)` | the path starts with `prefix` |
| `filterPathRegex(pattern)` | the path matches the PCRE `pattern` (delimiters included) |
| `filterMethodEquals(method)` | the HTTP method equals `method` (case-insensitive) |
| `filterMethodIn(methods)` | the HTTP method is one of `methods` |
| `filterHeaderEquals(name, value)` | header `name` equals `value` |
| `filterHeaderPresent(name)` | header `name` is present with any non-empty value |
| `filterHeaderRegex(name, pattern)` | header `name` matches the PCRE `pattern` |
| `filterIp(ipsOrCidrs)` | the client IP is in the list (CIDR-aware, IPv4/IPv6), backed by `IpMatcher` |
| `filterKnownScanners(patterns = null)` | the User-Agent matches a known scanner; `null` uses the curated default list, backed by `KnownScannerMatcher` |
| `filterSuspiciousHeaders(requiredHeaders = null)` | a required browser header is missing; `null` uses the default set, backed by `SuspiciousHeadersMatcher` |

`filterIp`, `filterKnownScanners`, and `filterSuspiciousHeaders` compile to the dedicated matcher classes (so you get their diagnostics and CIDR handling); the remaining filters compile to a request-predicate closure.

::: warning
`filterHeaderEquals`, `filterHeaderPresent`, and `filterHeaderRegex` are rejected on `safelist()` (and on `fromArray()` deserialize): a client-controlled header value would be a forgeable bypass token (anyone presenting it skips every downstream rule). They remain valid on blocklists, throttles, fail2ban, and track rules.
:::

### Key extractors

| Factory | Keys on |
|---------|---------|
| `keyIp()` | client IP resolved via the Config's IP resolver (else `REMOTE_ADDR`), like keyless rules and `filterIp()` |
| `keyMethod()` | HTTP method |
| `keyPath()` | request path |
| `keyHeader(name)` | raw value of header `name` |
| `keyHashedHeader(name)` | sha256 fingerprint of header `name`, preferred for credential-bearing headers (`Authorization`, `Cookie`, `X-Api-Key`) so the raw value never reaches the cache/ban registry |

::: tip
`keyIp()` is resolver-aware: it materializes as a keyless rule and late-binds to the evaluating `Config`'s IP resolver at runtime, exactly like keyless counter rules and `filterIp()`. Behind a CDN or load balancer, set proxy trust once on the `Config` with `$config->setIpResolver((new TrustedProxyResolver([...]))->resolve(...))` and all `keyIp()`-keyed rules (plus keyless rules and `filterIp()`) will key on the resolved client IP automatically. Without a resolver, `REMOTE_ADDR` is used.
:::

::: warning
Never trust `X-Forwarded-For` or similar headers without configuring trusted proxies via `TrustedProxyResolver`. A `TrustedProxyResolver` only reads forwarded headers when the connecting peer matches a declared trusted proxy address; without that, a client can spoof any IP by sending their own `X-Forwarded-For` header. See [Client IP behind proxies](/getting-started#client-ip-behind-proxies).
:::

### Pattern kinds (`PortableConfig::patternEntry()`)

Pattern backends carry a list of entries; each entry has a `PatternKind`:

| Kind | Matches |
|------|---------|
| `PatternKind::IP` | exact client IP |
| `PatternKind::CIDR` | client IP within a CIDR range |
| `PatternKind::PATH_EXACT` | exact path |
| `PatternKind::PATH_PREFIX` | path prefix |
| `PatternKind::PATH_REGEX` | path PCRE pattern |
| `PatternKind::HEADER_EXACT` | named header equals value (entry `target` = header name) |
| `PatternKind::HEADER_REGEX` | named header matches PCRE pattern (entry `target` = header name) |
| `PatternKind::REQUEST_REGEX` | pattern over path + query + headers |

`patternEntry()` also accepts optional `target`, `expiresAt`, `addedAt`, and a scalar `metadata` map, all of which round-trip as data, so an entry can carry its own expiry and provenance (handy when the catalogue lives in a database).

### Options

| Builder | Effect on the built `Config` |
|---------|------------------------------|
| `enableRateLimitHeaders()` | emit `X-RateLimit-*` headers |
| `enableResponseHeaders()` | emit `X-Phirewall-*` headers |
| `enableOwaspDiagnosticsHeader()` | emit the OWASP diagnostics header |
| `setFailOpen(bool)` | fail-open (default) vs fail-closed on backend errors |
| `setKeyPrefix(prefix)` | cache-key prefix |

## Rules in a database

Pattern backends and the portable schema are the natural fit for a block catalogue you maintain *outside* code, e.g. a `blocked_patterns` table or a threat feed. Store the (ideally [signed](#signed-transport)) ruleset in your store, and on each request load it and build the `Config`. Changing the stored rules then takes effect on the next request, with no deploy:

```php
use Flowd\Phirewall\Http\Firewall;
use Flowd\Phirewall\Portable\PortableConfig;

// $store->load() returns the signed blob from your DB / cache / config service.
$portable = PortableConfig::loadSigned($store->load(), $secret);
$firewall = new Firewall((new Config($cache))->with($portable));
```

Under classic PHP-FPM userland state does not carry over between requests, so this runs once per request and always reflects the current rules. To avoid querying the database on every request, put a shared cache (APCu, for example) in front of the store.

### Long-running workers

Under a long-running worker runtime (Swoole, RoadRunner, FrankenPHP worker mode, Octane) the process handles many requests, so keep the built `Firewall` in memory and rebuild it only when the stored ruleset version changes:

```php
// $store->load() returns ['version' => int, 'blob' => string].
$row = $store->load();
if ($loadedVersion !== $row['version']) {
    $portable = PortableConfig::loadSigned($row['blob'], $secret);
    $firewall = new Firewall((new Config($cache))->with($portable));
    $loadedVersion = $row['version'];
}
```

See [`examples/29-portable-config.php`](https://github.com/flowd/phirewall/blob/main/examples/29-portable-config.php) for a runnable version with the database simulated in memory.

## Signed transport

When the serialized config is read back from storage you do **not** fully control (a shared filesystem, an S3 bucket, etcd, a config service, a git repo that accepts external contributions), an attacker who can write the blob could inject an allow-all safelist and disable the firewall. `fromArray()` validates shape only, not authenticity.

`toSignedJson()` / `loadSigned()` close that gap with an HMAC-SHA256 envelope:

```php
$signed   = $portable->toSignedJson($secretKey);             // <header>.<payload>.<signature>
$restored = PortableConfig::loadSigned($signed, $secretKey); // verifies before returning
```

- The envelope is JWS-compact-style: `<header>.<payload>.<signature>`, where the signature is HMAC-SHA256 over `<header>.<payload>`.
- Verification uses a constant-time `hash_equals()` compare. Any tampering (payload edit, key substitution, or an `alg=none` downgrade attempt) is rejected with a `RuntimeException` *before* the rules are applied.
- Signing keys must be at least 16 bytes; **32 random bytes is recommended** (`random_bytes(32)`), stored in your secrets manager.

::: warning Threat model
Signing protects **integrity and authenticity**, not confidentiality: the payload is base64url-encoded, not encrypted, so anyone who can read the envelope can read the ruleset. Distribute the secret only to the producer and the consumers, rotate it like any other credential, and keep it out of the serialized blob. Signing also does not make a ruleset *safe to run* if you do not trust its author; it only proves the bytes were not altered after signing.

See [`examples/28-portable-config-signing.php`](https://github.com/flowd/phirewall/blob/main/examples/28-portable-config-signing.php) for a signing + tamper-rejection walkthrough.

## Not portable by design

A few capabilities cannot be represented as pure data and are intentionally **excluded** from the schema. Configure these directly on the `Config` you build before (or after) combining the portable rules in:

| Excluded | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Trusted-bot reverse-DNS safelisting (`TrustedBotMatcher`) | needs live DNS resolution and an optional cache at request time |
| OWASP Core Rule Set (`CoreRuleSetMatcher`, in `flowd/phirewall-preset-owasp-crs`) | a ruleset is parsed `SecRule` objects / rule files, not a small data blob |
| File-backed lists (`fileIp`, `filePatternBackend`) | filesystem paths are environment-specific; the in-memory pattern backend is the portable equivalent |
| Closure-driven dynamic throttle limits/periods, `$config->throttles->multi()` | limits/periods can be arbitrary PHP closures and cannot be serialized (express the multi-window case as several `throttles->add()` entries; `sliding` is supported) |
| Response factories, `ipResolver`, `discriminatorNormalizer` | these are closures / objects, not declarative data |
